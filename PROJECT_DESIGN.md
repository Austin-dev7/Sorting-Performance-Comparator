## 1. Project Overview

The Sorting Performance Comparator is a Python application that compares the execution time of different sorting algorithms.

The system allows users to:
- Generate random datasets
- Select sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Measure execution time
- Compare performance results

The purpose of this project is to analyze algorithm efficiency and understand the practical differences in time complexity.
