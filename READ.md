 # Sorting Performance Comparator

## Project Overview
This project compares the performance of different sorting algorithms by measuring how long they take to sort datasets of different sizes.  
It demonstrates the practical differences between algorithms with different time complexities.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Bubble Sort** – O(n²)  
- **Insertion Sort** – O(n²)  
- **Merge Sort** – O(n log n)  
- **Quick Sort** – O(n log n) (average case)  
- **Python Built-in Sort** – Highly optimized

## Files and Purpose
| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `main.py` | Runs the program and prints results |
| `generate.py` | Generates random datasets |
| `sorting_algorithms.py` | Contains sorting algorithm implementations |
| `time_utils.py` | Measures execution time |

## How to Run
1. Make sure all files are in the same folder.  
2. Open a terminal or PowerShell in the project folder.  
3. Run the program with:
   ```bash
   python main.py
