About This Project

This project compares different sorting algorithms to see which one is faster.

It allows the user to enter the size of a dataset, then it sorts the data using different algorithms and shows how long each one takes.

<!-- Algorithms Used -->

Bubble Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

<!-- How It Works -->
